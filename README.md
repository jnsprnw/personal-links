# Personal Links

Inspired by https://linktr.ee/, this project aims to provide a simple and customizable way to create a personal links page using SvelteKit and Pocketbase. Find my list on [links.jonasparnow.com](https://links.jonasparnow.com/).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```bash
make dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun run build
```
